# Sales_Data_SQLite

**Overview**
This project is an exploratory sales data analysis using SQL and PowerBI for visualizations. Based on Vinoth Kanna's educational dataset, I tasked myself with an introductory analysis of the data provided. I focused on three key sections: performance, customer, and product analysis. 

**Performance Analysis**
- Locate the top performing regions by sales.
- Locate the top performing sales representative by sales.
- Locate the top performing month for the most successful sales rep.
- Knowing all three, I narrowed my search to find the sales by the top sales rep, in the most successful region, and in their most productive month.

**Customer Analysis**
- Find the difference between new and returning customers
- Find the preferred payment type for customers - Split findings further my cutomers preferred payment type
- Find average sales by customer type
- Organize sales by product and customer type

**Product Analysis**
- Find highest selling products
- Find which products are the most profitable
- Calculate the average costs for each product
- Calculate the total costs for each product

**Programs Used**
* SQL
* SQLite
* Power BI
* Python Jupyter Notebook
